# Reth v1.10.2 Dependency Bump

## Context
The workspace pins multiple `reth-*` crates to `tag = "v1.10.1"` from the `paradigmxyz/reth` repository. We need to align all of these git dependencies to `v1.10.2` and refresh the lockfile so the workspace consistently pulls the new tag.

## Goals
- Update every `reth` git dependency tag in the root `Cargo.toml` from `v1.10.1` to `v1.10.2`.
- Regenerate `Cargo.lock` so the new tag and git revision are captured.
- Keep existing features, optional flags, and workspace overrides unchanged unless the new tag forces changes.

## Non-Goals
- No functional refactors or API changes outside what is required to compile.
- No new features or behavior changes unrelated to the version bump.

## Approach
1. Edit `Cargo.toml` and replace all `tag = "v1.10.1"` with `tag = "v1.10.2"` for `reth` and all `reth-*` dependencies.
2. Run a lightweight build step (at minimum `cargo check -p alethia-reth-bin`) to regenerate `Cargo.lock` and surface obvious incompatibilities.
3. Inspect `Cargo.lock` to confirm updated git `rev` entries for `https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth`.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Breaking changes in v1.10.2**: Address any compiler errors by consulting `/Users/davidcai/Workspace/reth` tag `v1.10.2` sources.
- **Mixed tag versions**: Ensure all `reth-*` entries are updated uniformly to avoid resolver conflicts.

## Validation
- `cargo check -p alethia-reth-bin` (minimum)
- Optional: `cargo check --workspace` if compilation errors appear.
